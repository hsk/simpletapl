I was looking for the beginning of a new statement.
If you just proceed without changing anything, I'll ignore
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

Sorry, I already gave what help I could...
Maybe you should try asking a human?
An error might have occurred before I noticed any problems.

You rang?
Try to insert some instructions for me (e.g.,`I show x'),
unless you just want to quit by typing `X'.

I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
